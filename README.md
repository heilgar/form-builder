# WYSISYG React Form builder

Extract from [Kinto Form Builder](https://github.com/Kinto/formbuilder)
based on [mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form)


**Existed fields:**
* Short text (input)
* Long text (textarea)
* Checkbox
* Multiple choices (checkbox group) 
* Choice list (radiobutton group)
* Select list (select)
* Date

Submit functionality is not working. So you could write there what ever you want

**Any comments/updates are welcome :)**
